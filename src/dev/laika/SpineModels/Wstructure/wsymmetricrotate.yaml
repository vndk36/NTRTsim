# This version of "W" structure Spine geometry was designed in such a way that the diagonal distances in the XZ plane from the core to subsequent nodes in same direction at a ratio of 1:2. 
nodes:
  Core: [0, 0, 0]
  LUBack: [6, 0, -4.243]
  LLBack: [6, -4.243, 0]

  LLFront: [-6, -8.485, 0]
  RUBack: [6, 4.243, 0]
  RLBack: [6, 0, 4.243]
  RUFront: [-6, 8.485, 0]
  RLFront: [-6, 0, 8.485]

# This version of "W" structure Spine geometry was designed in such a way that the diagonal distances in the XZ plane from the core to subsequent nodes in same direction at a ratio of 1:1. 
nodes:
  Core: [0, 0, 0]
  LUBack: [6,-3, -3]
  LLBack: [6,-3, 3]
  LUFront: [0,-6, -6]
  LLFront: [0,-6, 6]
  RUBack: [6, 3, -3]
  RLBack: [6, 3, 3]
  RUFront: [0, 6, -6]
  RLFront: [0, 6, 6]
